This repo is backend part of project "Offline Handwritten Text Extraction and Recognition of NCE Admission Form". This system aims to address the difficulties in maintaining and analyzing hard-copy NCE Admission forms through offline handwriting recognition for the English language using a CNN-BLSTM-CTC neural network. The system is trained and tested on the IAM database and implemented using image segmentation-based handwritten text recognition, with OpenCV performing image processing and TensorFlow used for network training and text recognition. The system enables users to upload images of the NCE Admission form, with the system rejecting any images that do not match the NCE Admission form format. Upon uploading a valid image, the form is processed, and the text within the required Regions of Interest (ROIs) is recognized and stored in a CSV file for further analysis. This digitizes admission form data and automates the data entry process, improving data efficiency. The handwriting recognition model attains a CER of around 9.33%, but accuracy depends on the camera or scanner, image orientation and quality. 
Developed as Minor Project By 4th year students at National college of Engineering.
